:navtitle: Commands
= Commands

This section describes the additional functionality attached to Axon's xref:axon-framework-reference:axon-framework-commands:index.adoc[command dispatching and handling] logic.

[[commandgateway]]
== `CommandGateway`

An inlined method has been introduced on the `CommandGateway` which allows the introduction of a dedicated function to be invoked upon success or failure of handling the command. As such it provides a shorthand instead of using the `CommandCallback` directly yourself.

Here is a sample of how this can be utilized within your own project:

[source,kotlin]
----
import org.axonframework.commandhandling.CommandMessage
import org.axonframework.commandhandling.gateway.CommandGateway
import org.axonframework.messaging.MetaData
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory

class CommandDispatcher(private val commandGateway: CommandGateway) {

    private val logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(CommandDispatcher::class.java)

    // Sample usage providing specific logging logic, next to for example the LoggingInterceptor
    fun issueCardCommand() {
        commandGateway.send(
                command = IssueCardCommand(),
                onSuccess = { message: CommandMessage<out IssueCardCommand>, result: Any, _: MetaData ->
                    logger.info("Successfully handled [{}], resulting in [{}]", message, result)
                },
                onError = { result: Any, exception: Throwable, _: MetaData ->
                    logger.warn(
                            "Failed handling the IssueCardCommand, with output [{} and exception [{}]",
                            result, exception
                    )
                }
        )
    }
}

class IssueCardCommand
